Of course! A clear Project Requirements Document (PRD) is the perfect next step. It will serve as your team's single source of truth, ensuring everyone is aligned and building towards the same goal.

Here is a comprehensive PRD for your GeoSafe AI project.

Project Requirements Document: GeoSafe AI

    Version: 1.0

    Author: Santhosh

    Date: September 23, 2025

1. Introduction

GeoSafe AI is an intelligent, real-time monitoring and alert system designed to proactively prevent rockfall accidents in open-pit mines. Traditional mine safety relies on periodic manual inspections, which are often dangerous and reactive. This project addresses that critical gap by leveraging a machine learning model to analyze geological data, predict high-risk zones, and instantly alert operators through an interactive dashboard. This transforms mine safety from a reactive to a proactive and data-driven discipline.

2. Project Goals & Objectives

    Primary Goal: To develop a functional proof-of-concept that successfully demonstrates an end-to-end flow from data input to a real-time, AI-driven alert on a user dashboard.

    Key Objectives:

        Enhance Safety: Provide mine operators with an early warning system to prevent injuries and save lives. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

        Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time between hazard detection and decision-making.

        Demonstrate Viability: Showcase the power of a modern microservice architecture (MERN + Python) in solving a critical industrial problem.

3. Target Audience

The primary user for this system is the Mine Shift Supervisor / Operator.

    Needs: They need a simple, clear, and unambiguous view of the mine's stability. They must be able to quickly understand where risks are developing and access the necessary information to validate a threat and take action (e.g., evacuate an area, halt operations).

    Pain Points: Currently, they rely on delayed reports and visual inspections, which can miss subtle, developing geological changes. They lack a single, live overview of the entire operational area.

4. Features & Functional Requirements

Here are the core features broken down into user stories.

Epic 1: Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

    1.1: Geospatial Map View: As a mine operator, I want to see a 2D map of the mine with all active sensor locations clearly plotted, so I can have a complete operational overview.

    1.2: Dynamic Risk Visualization: As a mine operator, I want each sensor icon on the map to be color-coded (e.g., Green for Low, Yellow for Medium, Red for High) based on the latest AI prediction, so I can instantly identify hotspots.

Epic 2: AI Prediction Engine (Microservice)

    2.1: Data Processing Endpoint: The system needs a secure API endpoint (/predict) that accepts geological and sensor data (e.g., slope angle, rainfall, vibration) in JSON format.

    2.2: Predictive Model: The system must use a pre-trained Scikit-learn classification model to analyze the incoming data and return a prediction with a risk level (High, Medium, Low) and a confidence score.

Epic 3: Instant Alerting System

    3.1: Real-Time Notifications: As a mine operator, when the AI predicts a "High" risk event, I want to receive an immediate and unmissable alert on the dashboard (e.g., a flashing map icon and a toast notification), so I am instantly aware of a critical threat.

Epic 4: Data Drill-Down & Verification

    4.1: Alert Details View: As a mine operator, when I click on a high-risk alert, I want a modal/sidebar to open that displays the critical sensor readings that triggered the alert, so I can understand the context.

    4.2: Visual Confirmation: In the alert details view, I want to see the latest available drone or satellite image of the alerted location, so I can visually confirm the physical situation on the ground.

5. System Architecture & Tech Stack

The project will be built using a microservice architecture to separate the user-facing application from the AI processing.

[React Frontend] <== (WebSockets) ==> [Node.js Backend] <== (REST API) ==> [Python AI Microservice]

    Frontend: React, Leaflet.js, Socket.IO Client, Axios

    Backend (Hub): Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

    AI Microservice: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas

6. Assumptions & Constraints

    Assumptions:

        A suitable, clean dataset for landslide/rockfall prediction is available on public repositories like Kaggle.

        Simulated sensor data is an acceptable substitute for live sensor feeds for this hackathon proof-of-concept.

    Constraints:

        The entire project must be developed and demonstrated within the 36-hour hackathon timeframe.

        The solution will be a software-only prototype; no hardware integration is required.

7. Success Metrics

    Primary Metric: A successful, live, end-to-end demonstration of the feature flow: simulated data triggers an AI prediction, which results in a real-time alert on the React dashboard.

    Secondary Metrics:

        A clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface.

        Positive feedback from judges on the project's technical architecture, innovation, and real-world impact. ‚ú®
